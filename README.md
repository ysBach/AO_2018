# AO Lecture Notes

All the lecture notes are primarily made by **Yoonsoo P. Bach**. I tried not to make typo, logically wrong statement, etc. If any problem is there in the note, that's solely my fault, so please be kind and let me know so that the notes can be updated.

* In 2018: This repo made. Many documents changed from ipynb to md.
* In 2017: Made GitHub repo [AO_2017](https://github.com/ysBach/AO_2017) and [website](https://ysbach.github.io/AO_2017/). They are still remaining as archive purpose.
* In 2016: No GitHub, but just MS Word-based lecture notes of PyRAF.

## TA Lecture Notes Outline

The following lecture notes *only* gives you idea how to use tools for data reduction. **You must be aware of what you are doing!** Identical procedure to the lecture note may give different results, depending on what you've done other than what I did when I make the notes.
